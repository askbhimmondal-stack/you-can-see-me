A simple web app that converts any YouTube link into an embedded video player.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it extracts the video ID from the URL and loads it dynamically inside an iframe.

This project is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and useful for learning DOM manipulation and video embedding.
